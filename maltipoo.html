      <h2 class="dogname">Maltipoo</h2>
      <p class="dogdesc"> Maltipoos are a "designer breed" that are a cross of the Maltese
        and Poodle, usually a miniature or toy poodle. These adorable little dogs are known
        to have been bred for hypoallergenic reasons, and of course for their adorable appearance
        and personalities! Due to their fluffy fur and affectionate and gentle nature, inherited
        from their parents breeds, Maltipoos are quite cuddly companions. These smart dogs are
        easy to train, and therefore are super great for the family and novice owners! <br> <br>
        The Maltipoos are widely known for their adorable teddy-bear like appearance, which have
        made them popular among celebrities and regular people alike. Despite being low in
        shedding and producing dander, these dogs have quite soft and fluffy coats that come in
        a variety of colors, with cream, white, and silver being the more common ones. Other
        than their appearance, Maltipoos are well known to be great companion dogs as they are
        very cuddly with their owners and generally friendly with everyone. The personality of
        a Maltipoo will depend on which traits it inherits from its ancestors. They tend to take on
        the smarts of the Poodle and the affection of the Maltese, but with a mix, the pup may
        lean more towards a certain breed more than the other. <br><br>
        Essentially, Maltipoos are extremely adorable dogs that many adore for their small size
        and cuddliness. With their hypoallergenic fur, gentle nature and intelligence, these charming
        pups are ideal dogs for novice owners and families!
