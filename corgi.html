      <h2 class="dogname">Corgi</h2>
      <p class="dogdesc"> Corgis, specifically the Welsh Corgis, are adorable dogs
        that originated from, well you guessed it, Wales. Don't let their short height and
        stubby legs fool you, corgis were originally bred for herding cattle, which
        resulted in these dogs' tendency to be smart and athletic! Corgis are easy to train,
        and are great around children and other pets, making these cuties a great family dog.
        But being originally bred as herd dogs, corgis need quite a bit of exercise and
        activities that will keep them moving. <br> <br>
        Welsh Corgis come in two varieties: the Pembroke and the Cardigan. Many breeders
        believe the two breeds developed separately. Both have similar heads, bodies, levels
        of intelligence and herding ability, but the Cardigan is slightly larger and heavier
        boned than the Pembroke. The easiest way to tell the difference between a Pembroke
        and a Cardigan is to look at the tails. Pembrokes' are docked and Cardigans' are long.
        Pembroke Corgi coats can be red, sable, fawn or tri-colored (red, black and tan),
        usually with white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle and belly.
        While Cardigan Corgi coats comes in all shades of red, sable, and brindle; black,
        with or without tan or brindle points; or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle
        points. They usually have white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle, belly and
        tail tip and may have a blaze on the head. <br><br>
        Overall, corgis are super cute, whether they are the Cardigan or Pembroke Corgi, and
        are great dogs to own, whether for new or experienced owners. Corgis are all around
        fun and friendly, and can offer a lot of great memories for those who love them.
