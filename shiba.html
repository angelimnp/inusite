      <h2 class="dogname">Shiba Inu</h2>
      <p class="dogdesc"> Shiba Inus are an ancient breed originating from Japan, which they
        were bred for hunting. Shibas are known for their spirited personality, small upright
        ears, and cat-like agility. Some may even compare them to foxes due to their physical
        features and colours! These bold and intelligent dogs are quite athletic despite being
        on the smaller side. Shiba Inus are also quite known to be stubborn, so be prepared
        to work hard when trying to train them! Still, the Shiba Inu can be a great dog for <thead>
        the family with proper socalization, training, and of course, love!
        </thead>
        <br> <br>
        The physical traits of Shiba Inus make this breed easy to distinguish. Their colors vary between
        red, red sesame, or black and tan, along with white markings usually around their face, neck, chest,
        and legs. What discerns these dogs the most from other types of dogs are their slanted eyes and
        pointed cat-like ears. Add a curly tail into the mix, and we have a Shiba Inu! Many compare these
        pups to cats, not just due to their appearance, but also due to their intelligence and independent
        nature. The Shiba Inu can be trained, but may not always be willing to listen to its owner, just
        like a cat would. <br><br>
        All in all, Shiba Inus are very adorable dogs and great companions to have. Although new owners
        may need to brace themselves to having to upkeep with their independent and freethinking ways.
        Shiba Inus are wonderful dogs and all around fun to be in the company of. So kawaii!
