      <h2>Hello There</h2>
      <p id="site-desc">This website is devoted for the love of dogs and the beauty and joy they possess!
        The site contains information about different dogs to help viewers learn about these cuties!
        A certain breed has its own page and each dedicated page describes the specific breed and
        the special characteristics the breed has. Of course there will be pictures of the dog
        on each page so viewers are able to see what the breeds look like and enjoy how cute
        these dogs are! <br> <br>
        The curator of this website also provides ratings for the dogs based on set criteria
        such as: cuteness, friendliness, and fluffiness! Do not worry as these ratings will
        be fair. Please keep in mind these ratings are based on the curator's opinions and
        not everyone will agree with them as people have their own opinions. <br><br>
        Feel free to go through the available dogs in this website. Please remember to view this
        website as entertainment, and it is not to be taken too seriously.
